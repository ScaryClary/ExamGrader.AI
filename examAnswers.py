"""Question: A mid-sized IT consulting firm is looking to switch to cloud computing to scale operations and improve efficiency. What things would they likely consider? Answer: Cloud computing is essentially using another computer for your computing processes. Some things to consider are the benefits. These include several factors. With cloud computing, the firm has the ability to access information so long as there is internet access. This is fairly easy, yet internet outages are potential problems. There is also the reduced costs of maintenance and construction of more computing systems. Since they would be using someone else's there is plenty of money to be saved. Finally, computing systems on the cloud can typically create a more global reach for companies who are expanding or already large. It is easier and simpler to share information this way.""",
"""Question: A large-sized agriculture company is considering using big data to optimize crop yields and reduce environment impact. Should they use big data? Why or why not? What should they consider when deciding if they should adopt this or not? Answer: Big data is data that is not easy to control or monitor, and there is a large volume of it being transferred very quickly. A large agricultural company should not use big data. Big data is better for companies like Facebook who have data that is supposed to be public. It is worth considering the cost of big data. Lack of privacy or security for data is something that typically comes with big data. Because the company doesn't want all of their information public and is not based on publicity, big data is likely not the move they want to make. They need safe storage of a lot of information. Something more along the lines of cloud computing, where they can access and transfer a lot of information safely.""",
"""Question: What are the benefits of blockchain? Give three benefits and examples with how it can be more beneficial than alternatives. Answer: Blockchain is a form of ledger with multiple entries. Some benefits include decentralization, consensus-based decisions, and private keys. Decentralization allows the ledgers to be less prone to problems from single companies or sites, meaning it is safer than the typical individual alternatives. Consensus-based decisions also make it better than alternatives because in order to make changes to the ledger, multiple people must communicate and come to a decision on what ledger is correct. This is safer for the user. Finally, private keys/secret keys are better due to the safety it grants each individual user. It means the user will still have access to things people with the public key cannot access.""",
"""Question: A Youtuber with lots of subscribers just posted a video stating that if I start taking metformin (a medicine for type 2 diabetes), then Iâ€™ll be able to live longer because it slows the aging process down. Should I start taking this medicine? Why or why not? How can I know if this is true or not? Answer: No, you should not start taking the medicine. Taking a medication because an internet personality says so is the equivalent of listening to a baker on how to fix a car. The individual could be right but have no trustworthy qualifications letting you know it is safe. In order to find out if it is true, you can simply ask a doctor or even the internet. Chances are the internet will give the correct answer through something like google, and if not, the doctor will be able to tell you.""",
